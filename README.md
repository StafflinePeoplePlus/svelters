# Svelte(rs)

A WIP parser for svelte files that is designed with error recovery and reporting in mind. This is
mostly a toy project for now, with some vague intention of improving editor tooling if I ever get
around to it. I am not intending to rewrite the svelte compiler in rust, though a project attempting
to do that might want to use this parser as a starting point.

This is very work-in-progress and can't parse most svelte code right now (it can't event parse
elements yet!).
